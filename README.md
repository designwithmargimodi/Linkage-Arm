# Solidworks Design

A fully-parametric 3D model and manufacturing drawing of a mechanical linkage arm designed in SolidWorks. This component is commonly used in mechanical assemblies such as suspension systems, actuator linkages, steering joints, and automation mechanisms.

This project includes:

- A complete 3D solid model of a linkage arm.
- Fully dimensioned 2D engineering drawing following ASME standards.
- Application of GD&T, hole callouts, radii, and tolerance blocks.
- A model designed with real-world manufacturability in mind.

# Manufacturing Considerations

- Material: AISI 1020 Steel 
- Thickness and hole sizes follow standard machining capabilities
- Fillet radii selected to reduce internal stress concentrations
- Straight sections optimized for CNC milling
- Cylindrical bosses sized for standard bearing/pin fits

# Real-Life Applications

- Mechanical linkages & lever arms
- Actuator-driven mechanisms
- Suspension joints
- Robotics end-effectors
- Packaging machine motion links
- Any mechanism requiring controlled rotation & translation
